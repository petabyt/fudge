To be clear, the following is not supported yet:

- Bluetooth
- Liveview
- Geotagging

## Finding the wireless menu
- Look for 'WIRELESS TRANSFER' or 'WIRELESS COMMUNICATION' in 'PLAYBACK MENU'
- On some cameras, the 'Fn' button opens up the WiFi menu by default

## Pairing over WiFi

Older cameras will have these options:
```
VIEW & OBTAIN IMAGES ON (phone)
SEND INDIVIDUAL IMAGES
SEND SELECTED MULTIPLE IMAGES
```

When you press a connection mode, you will get a screen like this:

```
   SEARCHING
FUJIFILM-X-A2-5DBC
SELECT Browse Camera
ON (phone) FUJIFILM APP
(OK) CHANGE   (BACK) CANCEL
```

If you are connecting for the first time, press `(OK) CHANGE`.

On your device, open WiFi settings and manually connect to the access point (aka hotspot) your camera is exposing. It will
start with FUJIFILM. Once you connect, you might need to confirm the connection in certain versions of Android.
