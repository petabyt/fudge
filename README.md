# Fudge
This is a cross-platform open-source alternative to Fujifilm's official camera app.  

[Website](https://fudge.danielc.dev/) | [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dev.danielc.fujiapp) | [F-Droid](https://apt.izzysoft.de/fdroid/index/apk/dev.danielc.fujiapp)

This app isn't finished yet, so don't set high expectations. Fuji's implementation of PTP/IP has many different quirks and bugs, so it's not easy to create a stable client that works for all cameras.

## Roadmap
- Frontend rewrite (see https://github.com/petabyt/fudge/issues/26)
- Liveview & Remote capture
- Implement Bluetooth pairing

## Compiling
```
git clone https://github.com/petabyt/fudge.git --depth 1 --recurse-submodules
```

### Compiling Android
Open android/ in Android Studio.

### Compiling desktop app
Desktop utility is still a work in progress.
```
# Ubuntu/Debian deps:
sudo apt install libusb-1.0-0-dev libimgui-dev libvulkan-dev libglfw3-dev
```
```
cd desktop
cmake -B build -G Ninja && cmake --build build
```
MinGW/osxcross is also supported for cross compiling.
